# Vue3-Traveling-App

I developed the app using Vue and Vite, while leveraging the free version of Xano's no-code tool for the backend, granting me 20 API calls per 10 seconds.

The application caters to a travel agency's needs, allowing users to peruse offers, accommodations, and various activities. Users can delve into details about each accommodation, restaurant, and store, including location, operating hours, and contact information. Likewise, they can explore activity specifics such as difficulty level and seasonal availability.

Upon logging in, users can select their desired stay dates and curate a personalized trip with daily activities and accommodation preferences. Once they finalize their itinerary and submit it, they will receive an email with the best offer tailored to their preferences.
