# Vue3-Traveling-App

I made the app using Vue and Vite, for the backend, I used the free version of the Xano no-code tool, which means I have 20 API calls per 10 seconds.

The application is intended for a travel agency where the user can explore the offer, accommodation, and various activities.
The user can find information about each accommodation, restaurant, and store such as location, working hours, and phone number.
It can also find information about each activity such as the difficulty, and what time of year the activity is available.

After that, the user can log in and choose the current days he wants to stay and create a trip of his own with activities for each day, and type of accommodation he want to stay. After the user makes a trip of his own and submits it, he will be contacted via email with the best offer for him.

If user does not fit into the offer and wants to find accommodation in a location of his choice, he has the option to explore Google Maps and find the ideal accommodation for himself.
